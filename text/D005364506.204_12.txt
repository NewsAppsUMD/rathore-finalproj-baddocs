Employee Interviews Regarding Sexual Misconduct/Inappropriate Touching
10. On or about February 13, 2024, the Board conducted an interview with a
former employee of the Respondent (“Employee 2”) who stated the following:
a. Employee 2 worked for the Respondent for approximately one
year beginning in or around 2015. Employee 2 reached out to the
Respondent’s office in or around July 2022 for an employment
opportunity. Employee 2 was invited for an in-person interview
shortly thereafter.
b. During the re-hire interview in 2022, the Respondent began
talking about his personal life and his marital status. The
Respondent also mentioned that he had a new car and asked her if
she wanted to take a ride. Employee 2 agreed, thinking that the
ride would be around the business park where the office was
located. When Employee 2 noticed they were leaving
Chestertown, she asked him where they were going and the
Respondent stated he was “going to show [her] where he lived.”
Employee 2 told him no and that she did not have much time but

the Respondent said “it’s going to be really quick, really quick.”
