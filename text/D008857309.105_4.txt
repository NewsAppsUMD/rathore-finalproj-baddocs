patient management responsibilities. Despite prior interventions, the Respondent’s conduct
persisted and raised concerns about his ability to function within a multidisciplinary care
environment.

8. On or about December 1, 2022, the Respondent became the subject of a
formal workplace complaint following an incident in which he confronted a Certified
Registered Nurse Anesthetist (“CRNA”) during preoperative preparations. Witnesses
described the Respondent's conduct towards the CRNA as loud, aggressive, and
intimidating, requiring staff intervention. The CRNA resigned shortly thereafter.

9. On or about October 27, 2023, the Respondent engaged in an exchange with
staff of Facility | regarding the transfer and monitoring of a postoperative patient. The
Respondent was alleged to have questioned the actions of nursing staff, challenged
established telemetry protocols, while using an aggressive and dismissive tone. The matter
escalated to clinical leadership and prompted a formal family complaint.

10. On or about April 21, 2024, the Respondent refused to accept responsibility
for an elderly patient referred to him for possible general surgical intervention. Despite
being on call and being contacted by Facility 1 staff, the Respondent declined to evaluate
the patient, asserting that the matter was not within his scope. The Chief Medical Officer
ultimately directed him to report in person to Facility 1. Staff reported that the
Respondent’s dismissive tone and failure to engage in timely collaboration caused
confusion among care teams and delayed surgical management.

11. Following this incident, the Respondent entered into discussions with

Facility 1 and agreed to separate from employment effective May 2024.
