on the Respondent testing positive for an elevated blood alcohol level on August 28, 2023,
after performing a procedure on a patient.
II. BOARD INVESTIGATION

5. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained medical and administrative
records from the Facility and other health care facilities with which the Respondent was
employed or associated. The Board also obtained a written response from the Respondent.

6. The Board’s investigation revealed that on or about August 28, 2023, the
Respondent was scheduled to perform a medical procedure on a patient at the Facility at
9:00 a.m. By 9:40 a.m. the Respondent had not arrived at the Facility, which prompted a
staff member to contact him. The Respondent finally arrived at the Facility at 9:53 a.m.

7. Upon the Respondent’s arrival, Facility staff members observed the
Respondent to be disheveled with the bottom of his pant leg tucked into his sock, his hair
unkempt and his shirt stained with deodorant. Facility staff members noticed the
Respondent’s speech was disjointed and slow. The Respondent proceeded to perform the
scheduled procedure and was observed to be “hyperfocused on each step of the procedure,
as if he was trying to remember what was to come next.” The Respondent performed the
procedure without any issues, but a Facility staff observed him to be rude when speaking
with the patient.

8. The Facility administrative staff decided not to allow the Respondent to
perform anymore procedures after the first patient. While Facility staff members were
speaking with the Respondent about his behavior in a consulting room, the Respondent

began retching and vomiting.
