appear, the ALJ commenced the Prehearing Conference. The State made a motion for
default against Dr. Bentley.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice as provided in
Regulation .OSC of this chapter, a party fails to attend or participate, either personally or
through a representative, in a Prehearing Conference, hearing, or other stage of a
proceeding, the ALJ may proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the
hearing authority delegated by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against
the defaulting party.” COMAR 28.02.01.23A.

On February 9, 2024, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found
that Dr. Bentley had proper notice of the February 5, 2024, remote Prehearing Conference
and that she failed to appear or participate. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Dr.
Bentley in default, adopt as findings of fact the statements set forth in the allegations of
fact section of the charges, and conclude as a matter of law that Dr. Bentley violated Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). The ALJ did not propose a sanction.

The ALJ mailed, by regular first-class mail, copies of the Proposed Default Order
to Dr. Bentley, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board at each respective address of
record. The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file written
exceptions to the Proposed Default Order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the
Proposed Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and

requests for a hearing must be sent to the Board with a copy provided to the opposing party.
