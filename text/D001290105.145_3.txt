of your inability to appear for the prehearing conference may result in a decision against
you.” The United States Postal Service did not return the Notice to OAH as undeliverable
or for any other reason.

On February 10, 2025, the ALJ convened the remote prehearing conference via
Webex as scheduled. COMAR 28.02.01.20B(1)(b). The Administrative Prosecutor
appeared, representing the State. Neither the Respondent nor anyone authorized to
represent the Respondent appeared at the remote prehearing conference. The ALJ waited
thirty minutes, until 10:00 a.m., but the Respondent and/or his representative still failed to
appear. The State moved for an order of default against the Respondent, and the State
sought the revocation of the Respondent’s license to practice medicine in Maryland.

Under OAH’s Rules of Procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice ... a party fails
to attend or participate, either personally or through a representative, in a prehearing
conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the ALJ may proceed in that party’s
absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the agency, issue a
final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR 28.02.01.23A.

Similarly, § 14-405 of the Health Occupations Article provides, in pertinent part:

(d) If after due notice the individual against whom the action is
contemplated fails or refuses to appear, nevertheless the hearing
officer may hear and refer the matter to the Board or a disciplinary
panel for disposition.

(e) After performing any necessary hearing under this section, the
hearing officer shall refer proposed factual findings to the Board or

a disciplinary panel for the Board’s or disciplinary panel’s
disposition.
