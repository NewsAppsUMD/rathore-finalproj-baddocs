Conference and that he failed to appear or participate. The ALJ proposed that the Panel
find Dr. Otchere-Boateng in default, adopt as findings of fact the statements set forth in the
allegations of fact section of the charges, and conclude as a matter of law that Dr. Otchere-
Boateng violated the Medical Practice Act. The ALJ did not propose a sanction.

The ALJ mailed, by regular first-class mail, copies of the Proposed Default Order
to Dr. Otchere-Boateng, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board at each respective
address of record. The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file
written exceptions to the proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the
Proposed Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and
requests for a hearing must be sent to the Board with a copy provided to the opposing party.
On March 25, 2024, the Board also mailed and emailed notice of the exceptions process to
Dr. Otchere-Boateng at his addresses of record.

On April 5, 2024, the State filed written exceptions noting that a sanction was not
proposed by the ALJ and requested that the Panel revoke Dr. Otchere-Boateng’s license.
On May 8, 2024, Board Disciplinary Panel A held an exceptions hearing. The exceptions
hearing was scheduled for 10:30 a.m., and Panel A waited until 10:48 am. Dr. Otchere-
Boateng did not appear. The Administrative Prosecutor appeared, submitted on her written
exceptions, and did not make further oral arguments.
