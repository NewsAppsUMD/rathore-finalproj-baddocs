On February 11, 2025, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ cited
OAH’s Rules of Procedure in conjunction with § 14-405(d), which provides that the ALJ
“may hear” the matter if a party fails to appear, and with § 14-405(e), which uses the
language “any necessary hearing.” The ALJ found that these provisions authorize defaults,
requiring no evidentiary hearing on the merits. See also COMAR 28.02.01.23A.

The ALJ found that the Respondent had proper notice of the February 10, 2025
Remote Prehearing Conference and failed to attend or participate in the Remote Prehearing
Conference. The ALJ thus proposed that the Respondent be found in default and further
proposed that the Allegations of Fact section of the charges be adopted as fact. The ALJ
further proposed that the Respondent be found to have violated Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)Gi), (13), (33), and (43) and Heath-Gen. § 4-403(b), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (e)(1),
(e)(2)G), and (e)(2)(ii). Moreover, the ALJ proposed that the Respondent’s license to
practice medicine in Maryland be revoked. The proposed default order notified the parties
that they may file exceptions but must do so within 15 working days of the date of the
proposed default order. The proposed default order was mailed and emailed to the parties
at their respective addresses of record.

Neither party filed exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order.

Respondent defaulted, the following findings of fact are adopted from the allegations of

fact set forth in the charges and are deemed proven by the preponderance of the evidence:
