Re: Daniel Metz, PA
Case No.: 2225-0171
License No.: C05820

Dear Mr. Metz and Counsel:

On June 3, 2025, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE AS A
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2).
Mr. Metz was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on June 18, 2025, before
Disciplinary Panel B, to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. On June 16,
2025 counsel for Mr. Metz informed the Panel that Mr. Metz was waiving the opportunity to attend
the post-deprivation hearing.

Accordingly, a hearing was not held and Disciplinary Panel B has determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Mr. Metz’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Mr. Metz’s continued
practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the summary
suspension imposed on June 3, 2025, is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).
