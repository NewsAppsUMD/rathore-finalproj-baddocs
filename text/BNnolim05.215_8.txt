20. By email dated February 6, 2024, the Applicant informed Board staff that he
was “glad you received the documents regarding the so called misdemeanor arrest in
2006.” He stated, “[I]t was a pure domestic dispute between me and my now ex wife(.]”
The Applicant further stated, "I was not the person that initiated the NC License when it
was supposedly done in 2012.”

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel A finds Dr. Nnolim in default based upon his failure to appear or participate
at the Prehearing Conference on February 27, 2025, at OAH. See State Gov’t § 10-210(4).
Panel A finds, under Health Occ. § 14-205(b)(3)(i), reasons that are grounds for the denial
of Dr. Nnolim’s application for medical licensure in Maryland under Health Occ. § 14-
404. Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, Panel A concludes that Dr. Nnolim:
fraudulently or deceptively attempted to obtain a license for the applicant, in violation of
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1); committed unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); willfully made or filed a false report or record
in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(11); willfully made a
false representation when seeking or making application for licensure, in violation of
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(36); and failed to meet the qualifications for licensure under
Subtitle 3 of the Medical Practice Act, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(44). Finally,
the Board finds that Dr. Nnolim does not possess good moral character, which is a

requirement of licensure. See Health Occ. § 14-307(b).
