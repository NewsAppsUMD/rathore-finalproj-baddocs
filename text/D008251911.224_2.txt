5. The Board’s investigation revealed that the Respondent had missed work and
that he had been suffering from alcohol dependency, which led to multiple hospitalizations
starting in 2021.

6. On or about December 12, 2023, the Respondent was assigned to work the
Emergency Care Management (ECM) shift. His responsibilities included consulting with
nurses and physicians regarding patient care and making decisions regarding the transfer
of patients to appropriate facilities. During the shift, the Respondent was sent medical
information and patient charts for review. However, his notes were incomplete, unclear
and failed to address the questions posed to him and contained grammatical errors. The
Respondent’s notes lacked essential clinical information, including patient history, vital
signs, and documentation of consults with the emergency room physicians, raising concern
regarding the Respondent’s ability to safely practice medicine.

Te On or about December 14, 2023, the Respondent was scheduled to work the
ECM schedule from 6 am to 4 pm. Around noon the Respondent abandoned his shift,
ceased responding to calls, and staff were unable to reach him. The Respondent failed to
notify anyone that he left his shift resulting in delays of patient treatment.

8. The Respondent was eventually contacted in the evening by his Chief
Supervisor (“Physician A”) and told his supervisor that he left because his dog was sick.
Physician A described the Respondent’s behavior as incoherent, rambling, and repetitive,
suggesting that the Respondent appeared to be under the influence. A welfare check was
conducted by a co-worker physician (“Physician B”), who observed multiple empty wine

bottles at the Respondent’s residence and disposed of them.
