License No.: D59281

Dear Dr. Malik and Ms. Miller:

On July 31, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).

Pursuant to the Order, on August 14, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A held a post-deprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Malik did not attend the
hearing on that date. The State was represented by JoAnna Miller, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Ms. Miller presented oral arguments arguing that the summary
suspension should be upheld.

After considering the State’s argument at the hearing and the documents in the
investigative file, Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary
suspension imposed on July 31, 2024. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary
suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare
imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Malik’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).
