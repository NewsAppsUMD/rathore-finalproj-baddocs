NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under COMAR 10.32.02.08I, Dr. Moran has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge on the order for summary suspension. This request will be
granted if the Board receives a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of
this letter. The request for a hearing shall be sent to:

Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director
Maryland Board of Physicians

4201 Patterson Avenue, Fourth Floor
Baltimore, Maryland 21215

If such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
a hearing within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.081, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from a
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore, a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File

Ellen Douglas Smith, Deputy Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
