Respondent touching her was not an accident when it happened
two more times.

. After the first time that the Respondent touched her, Employee 3
mentioned it to Employee 2 who said, “He did it to me as well.”
Employee 2 said that while she was at the Respondent’s house,
she “had a dress on or something, and he put his — put his hand
up her dress, made her feel uncomfortable and she left.”

. The Respondent would also hug Employee 3 and get close to her.
“[W]hen he would grab my butt, like, he would stand, like, in
front of me, and we would be, like, face to face, like we were
having a conversation. And then he would get closer to me, and
then take one hand around my body and grab, like, my butt.”
Sometimes when Employee 3 was standing next to the
Respondent, he would also put his arm “over my shoulder and
kind of like hug me that way, or you know, pull me closer to him
that way, if that makes sense.”

The first time that the Respondent touched Employee 3, she “was
just like, what the f---? And I walked out.” When it happened a
second time, “I put, like, my fingers like, in his chest, like, you

know, to like back him up, you know.”
