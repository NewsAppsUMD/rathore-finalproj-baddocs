FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

On June 12, 2023, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) charged Darrell E. Lewis, M.D., License Number D76104, with
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, being professionally, physically, or mentally
incompetent, willfully making or filing a false report in the practice of medicine, willfully making
a misrepresentation in treatment, and selling, prescribing, giving away, or administering drugs for
illegal or illegitimate medical purposes. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”) § 14-
404(a) (3)(ii), (4), (11), (17) and (27). On August 18, 2023, Dr. Lewis resolved the charges against
him through a Consent Order with Panel B that reprimanded him and suspended his medical
license for a minimum of one year and until the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”) notified the Board that he was safe to return to the practice of medicine. On August
30, 2024, Panel B charged Dr. Lewis for violating the terms of his Consent Order by testing
positive for an illicit substance in violation of his Participant Rehabilitation Agreement he entered
into with MPRP.

The case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an
evidentiary hearing and a proposed decision on whether Dr. Lewis violated the Consent Order he
entered into with the Panel. On January 28, 2025, a hearing was held before an Administrative
Law Judge (“ALJ”) at OAH. At the hearing, the State presented testimony from two witnesses

and Dr. Lewis represented himself and testified on his own behalf.
