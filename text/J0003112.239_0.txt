Procedural History

On January 8, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) issued a Notice of Intent to Revoke License to Practice Naturopathic Medicine against
Respondent Abigail Aiyopola, N.D., under the Maryland Naturopathic Medicine Act, Md. Code
Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-5F-01—14-5F-32, with willfully making of filing a false report in the
practice of naturopathic medicine, Health Occ. § 14-SF-18(a)(9); unprofessional or immoral
conduct in the practice of naturopathic medicine, Health Occ. § 14-5F-18(a)(19); and failing to
cooperate with a lawful investigation of the Board, Health Occ. § 14-5F-18(a)(24). The notice
alleged that the Respondent failed to comply with section 14-SF-15(c)(5) of the Health
Occupations Article, which states, “[t]he Board shall renew the license of a licensee who...

“CPR certificate and that the Respondent failed to respond to the Board’s investigative
correspondence. The notice also notified the Respondent that, if a disciplinary panel concluded
that the Respondent violated any Health Occ. § 14-5F-18 grounds, disciplinary sanctions could

be imposed against her. The case was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings -
