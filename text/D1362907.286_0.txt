Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
License Number: D13629
Case Number: 2015-0610A

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of Disciplinary Panel A:

Please be advised that I have decided to PERMANENTLY SURRENDER my
license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D13629, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot
prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of
Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Code
Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-101 et seq. (2014 Repl. Vol.) and other applicable laws. In other
words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the
surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed
individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT and that
upon the acceptance of Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians,
becomes a FINAL ORDER of the panel.

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my urology practice
and on May 25, 2016, Disciplinary Panel A subsequently issued disciplinary charges
against me. Specifically, the charges alleged that I performed inappropriate pelvic and
rectal examinations on multiple female patients in a manner that compromised their
dignity and made them feel uncomfortable, without adequate clinical rationale,
explanation or consent. I further acknowledge that I performed pelvic and rectal
examinations of female patients who presented with kidney stones or other urologic
symptoms or conditions.
