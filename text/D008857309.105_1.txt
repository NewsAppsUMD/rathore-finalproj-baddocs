JOINT COMMISSION SENTINEL EVENT ALERT, 2008

On July 9, 2008, the Joint Commission issued a Sentinel Event alert entitled
“Behaviors that Undermine a Culture of Safety,” which stated in pertinent part:

Intimidating and disruptive behaviors can foster medical crrors . .. contribute
to poor patient satisfaction and to preventable adverse outcomes . . . Safety
and quality of patient care is dependent on teamwork, communication, and a
collaborative work environment. To assure quality and to promote a culture
of safety, health care organizations must address the problem of behaviors
that threaten the performance of the health care team. Intimidating and
disruptive behaviors include overt actions such as verbal outbursts and
physical threats . . . Intimidating and disruptive behaviors are often
manifested by health care professionals in positions of power... Overt and
passive behaviors undermine team effectiveness and can compromise the
safety of patients . . . All intimidating and disruptive behaviors are
unprofessional and should not be tolerated.!-?

AMA OPINION 9.045, June 2000
AMA Opinion 9.045, entitled, Physicians with Disruptive Behavior, adopted in
June 2000, states in pertinent part:

(1) Personal conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or
that potentially may negatively affect patient care constitutes disruptive
behavior. (This includes but is not limited to conduct that interferes with
one’s ability to work with other members of the health care team.)
However, criticism that is offered in good faith with the aim of improving
patient care should not be construed as disruptive behavior.

* In 2011, the Joint Commission revised the term “disruptive behavior” to “behavior or behaviors that
undermine a culture of safety.”

* In 2016, the Joint Commission noted that “while the term “unprofessional behavior’ is preferred instead
of “disruptive bchavior;’ the suggested actions in this alert remain relevant.”
