Case No.: 7724-0049
License No.: D58701

Dear Dr. Clem and Ms. Miller:

On April 11, 2024, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2022 Repl. Vol.). Dr. Clem
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on April 24, 2024, before
Disciplinary Panel B, to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Clem
appeared at the post-deprivation hearing by phone and the Administrative Prosecutor appeared at
the hearing in person. Dr. Clem did not contest the summary suspension or argue that the
suspension should not be continued. The administrative prosecutor advocated for the continuation
of the summary suspension.

After consideration of the presentations from the State and Dr. Clem, Disciplinary Panel B
determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public
imperatively required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Clem’s license and there
exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Clem’s
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the
summary suspension imposed on April 11, 2024, is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
