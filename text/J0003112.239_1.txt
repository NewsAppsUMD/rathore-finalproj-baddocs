After written notice, issued August 9, 2019, to the Respondent and the State, OAH held a
Scheduling Conference on August 27, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., at OAH, in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
The Respondent did not appear for the Scheduling Conference, and no one appeared on her
behalf, The State was represented by the Administrative Prosecutor from the Maryland Office of
the Attorney General, who appeared at the conference. After waiting approximately twenty
minutes for the Respondent to appear, the State moved for entry of a default judgment.

Under OAH’s Rules of Procedure, “{i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to
attend or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge
may proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated
by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28,02.01.23A. Similarly, the Health Occupations Article provides, in pertinent part:

(d) If after due notice the individual against whom the action is
contemplated fails or refuses to appear, nevertheless the hearing officer
may hear and refer the matter to the Board or a disciplinary panel for
disposition,
(e) After performing any necessary hearing under this section, the
hearing officer shall refer proposed factual findings to the Board or a
disciplinary panel for the Board’s or disciplinary panel’s disposition.

and “any necessary hearing” in subsection (e) clearly contemplate situations such as defaults
_where no hearing on the merits is required.
