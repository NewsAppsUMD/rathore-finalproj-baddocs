On March 12, 2025, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. In the Proposed
Default Order, the ALJ found that Dr. Nnolim failed to appear or participate in the
rescheduled remote Prehearing Conference. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Dr.
Nnolim in default and found that by failing to appear he has withdrawn his challenge to the
Notice of Intent to Deny Application. The ALJ proposed that the Board adopt as findings
of fact the statements set forth in the allegations of fact section of the Notice of Intent to
Deny Application for Initial Medical License and conclude as a matter of law that Dr.
Nnolim violated sections 14-307(b), 14-404(a)(1), ()(ii), (11), (36), and (44) of the
Maryland Medical Practice Act. The ALJ recommended denying Dr. Nnolim’s application
for licensure.

The ALJ mailed, by regular first-class mail, copies of the Proposed Default Order
to Dr. Nnolim, Dr. Nnolim’s counsel, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board at each
respective address of record. The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they
may file written exceptions to the proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date
of the Proposed Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and
requests for a hearing must be sent to the Board with a copy provided to the opposing party.
Neither party filed exceptions. On May 14, 2025, this case came before Disciplinary Panel
A (“Panel A”) of the Board for final disposition.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Because Panel A concludes that Dr. Nnolim has defaulted and has not filed

exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order, the following findings of fact are adopted
