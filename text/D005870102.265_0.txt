ORDER TERMINATING SUSPENSION AND IMPOSING PROBATION
On July 31, 2024, Disciplinary Panel B (the ‘“Panel”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) and Jason Clem, M.D. (the “Respondent”) entered into a Consent Order
whereby the Panel concluded, as a matter of law, that Dr. Clem was professionally, physically, or

mentally incompetent, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4); and habitually intoxicated, in

violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(7).

Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Panel reprimanded the Respondent, terminated the
Order of Summary Suspension dated April 11, 2024 as moot, and suspended him for a minimum
period of six (6) months and until the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program ("MPRP") finds
and notifies the Board that he is safe to return to the practice of medicine.

Six (6) months have passed from the July 31, 2024 Consent Order and MPRP has notified the
Board that the Respondent is safe to return to the practice of medicine.

TERMINATED; and it is further

ORDERED that the reprimand imposed by the July 31, 2024 Consent Order remains in effect;
