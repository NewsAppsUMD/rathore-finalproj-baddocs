practice of medicine, failing to meet standards of quality medical care, and inadequate
documentation.

48. The Final Decision and Order, in 2013, was the result of the Respondent signing a
Certificate of Merit in a medical malpractice action without first reviewing the medical records,
falsifying a progress note in a patient’s medical record, inappropriately prescribing opioid
medications by increasing dosages of opioids, failing to reduce dosages of opioids, failing to
address addictions, and failing to refer patients to pain medicine specialists.

49, The Board suspended the Respondent’s medical license until he completed Board-
approved courses in pain management, medical ethics, and medical record-keeping.

50. On September 10, 2013, after the Respondent completed the required courses, the
Board issued an Order Terminating Suspension and Imposing Probation (“Probation Order”). The
Respondent was placed on probation for a minimum of three years under the condition that his
practice be subject to peer and/or chart review and that he comply with the Maryland Medical
Practice Act.

51. On July 30, 2014, after a hearing before an ALJ, the Board issued a Final Decision
and Order, concluding the Respondent had failed to meet standards of quality medical care based
on his improper prescribing of opioids and his treatment of a patient with suicidal depression. The
Respondent was still on probation to address the issues in the 2013 case. The Board reprimanded
the Respondent.

52. On July 11, 2016, after a hearing before an ALJ, the Disciplinary Panel A of the
Board issued an Amended Final Decision and Order, concluding the Respondent violated the
September 10, 2013 Probation Order and failed to meet standards of quality care based on his

failure to provide safe and effective treatment for chronic pain.
