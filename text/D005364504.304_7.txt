then like I said, oh, then it must be really just cultural stuff. But they
said no. So that’s when I felt uncomfortable, and I told them.”

c. Employee 4 told the Respondent that she was not comfortable with
him giving her hugs. When she told him “... he was not happy. To me,
he seemed a little bit offended because probably he didn’t — it was
impromptu, and maybe it was just casual for him.”

11, On or about March 22, 2024, the Board conducted an interview with a former
employee of the Respondent (“Employee 5”) who stated the following:

a. Employee 5 was employed by the Respondent from on or around
March 2021 through January 2022 at the Chestertown office location.

b. Employee 5 worked with Employee 3 and would usually leave a few
minutes before Employee 3. One day when Employee 5 was about to
leave, Employee 3 asked Employee 5 to wait for her. Employee 3
asked Employee 5 to wait for her on multiple other occasions because
she did not “want to be left [there] alone with [the Respondent].”
Employee 5 questioned Employee 3 about the situation and Employee
3 said “...I don’t want it going around, but she did mention that [the
Respondent] had touched her bottom.” Employee 3 did not know if it
was an accident but “... she was just caught off guard that she didn’t
even know what to think of that circumstance.”

c. Employee 3 asked Employee 5 if the Respondent had ever touched
her. Employee 5 asked Employee 3 why she had asked that question

and Employee 3 “... said that he had touched her bottom again.”
