Re: Paul Beals, M.D.
Case No.: 2225-0116
License No.: D0025922

Dear Dr. Beals and Ms. Miller:

On February 26, 2025, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). On March
12, 2025, Dr. Beals was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Beals did
not attend the hearing on that date. The State was represented by JoAnna Miller, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Ms. Miller presented oral arguments arguing that
the summary suspension should be upheld.

After considering the State’s arguments at the hearing and the documents in the
investigative file, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the
health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively required the disciplinary panel to
summarily suspend Dr. Beals’s license and there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the
public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Beals’s continued practice. See State Gov’t, § 10-
226(c)(2)(i). Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the
summary suspension imposed on February 26, 2025 is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
