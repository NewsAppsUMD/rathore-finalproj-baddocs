that it previously used, and the notice was not returned as undeliverable. Dr. Nnolim further
did not notify OAH of any change of mailing address.

On February 27, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., the ALJ convened the remote prehearing
conference. The administrative prosecutors appeared for the state, and neither Dr. Nnolim
nor his counsel appeared at the scheduled start time or at any point before 9:55 a.m. when
the ALJ adjourned the matter. Dr. Nnolim did not request a postponement or notify OAH
of any technical issues with logging on. The ALJ found that Dr. Nnolim failed to appear
despite having received proper notice.

The State proffered that the settlement negotiations had failed and that Dr. Nnolim
sought to withdraw his application, but his request was denied by the Board. The State
proffered that Dr. Nnolim’s counsel communicated to him that Dr. Nnolim and his counsel
would no longer participate in the proceedings. The State proffered that Dr. Nnolim’s
counsel reiterated that he and Dr. Nnolim would not appear for the prehearing conference.
The State made a motion for default against Dr. Nnolim.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice as provided in
Regulation .05C of this chapter, a party fails to attend or participate, either personally or
through a representative, in a Prehearing Conference, hearing, or other stage of a
proceeding, the ALJ may proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the
hearing authority delegated by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against

the defaulting party.” COMAR 28.02.01.23A.
