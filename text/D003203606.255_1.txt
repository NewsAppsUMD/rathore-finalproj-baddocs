The case was delegated to the Office of Administrative Hearings for an evidentiary hearing
and the issuance of a proposed decision with proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of
law, and a proposed disposition.

An Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) for the Office of Administrative Hearings held an
evidentiary hearing on September 23 and 24, 2024, via the Webex videoconferencing platform.
An Assistant Attorney General from the Health Occupations Prosecution and Litigation Unit
(“HOPL”) of the Office of the Attorney General presented the case for the State. The Respondent
represented himself.

On December 16, 2024, the ALJ who presided over the evidentiary hearing issued a
proposed decision. Based on the proposed findings of fact, the ALJ proposed that the charges be
upheld, concluding that Dr. Sprouse violated the grounds charged: Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii),
(11), (17), and (23). As a sanction, the ALJ proposed that Dr. Spouse be reprimanded, his license
to practice medicine in Maryland be suspended for six months, he take a course in ethics, and he
pay a fine of $35,000.

Dr. Sprouse filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision, and the Administrative
Prosecutor filed a response. On March 26, 2025, an exceptions hearing was held before
Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B” or the “Panel”) of the Board. At the exceptions hearing, an
Administrative Prosecutor from HOPL, was present and represented the State, and the Respondent
was present and represented himself.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel B finds that the following facts were proved by the preponderance of evidence:
1. At all relevant times to the charges in this matter, the Respondent was licensed to

practice medicine in Maryland.
