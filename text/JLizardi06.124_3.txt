On February 8, 2024, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. In the Proposed
Default Order, the ALJ found that Dr. Lizardi failed to appear or participate in the remote
Prehearing Conference. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Dr. Lizardi in default, adopt
as findings of fact the statements set forth in the allegations of fact section of the charges,
and conclude as a matter of law that Dr. Lizardi violated the Medical Practice Act and
sexual misconduct regulations. The ALJ recommended denying Dr. Lizardi’s application
for licensure.

The ALJ mailed, by regular first-class mail, copies of the Proposed Default Order
to Dr. Lizardi, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board at each respective address of
record. The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file written
exceptions to the proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed
Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and requests for a
hearing must be sent to the Board with a copy provided to the opposing party. Neither
party filed exceptions. On April 10, 2024, this case came before Disciplinary Panel A
(“Panel A”) of the Board for final disposition.
