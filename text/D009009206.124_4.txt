' Dr. Otchere-Boateng’s license was set to expire on September 30, 2023. Dr. Otchere-Boateng’s license
did not expire because of his non-renewal, however. A license may not “lapse by operation of law while
the individual is under investigation or while charges are pending.” Health Occ. § 14-403(a); see also
Salerian v. Board of Physicians, 176 Md. App. 231, 247 (2007). Because the charges against Dr. Otchere-
Boateng were still “pending” as that term is used in the statute in September 2023, his license did not lapse
or expire and remained active for disciplinary purposes throughout the Board’s charging and administrative
proceedings.
