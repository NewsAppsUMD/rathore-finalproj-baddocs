Walter Gianelle, M.D. License Number: D44413
Case Number: 7723-0042 & 2224-0106

Dear Dr. Olszyk and Members of Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health. Occ.”)
§14-403, I have decided to PERMANENTLY SURRENDER my license to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D44413, effective immediately. |
understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice or treatment
to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or
otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in
the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seg. and other
applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Permanent Letter of
Surrender, | understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

1 understand that this Permanent Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT,
and upon Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of
Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that on December 15, 2022, the Panel issued an Order to
Terminate Suspension and Impose Probation, which placed me on probation for a
minimum of three years with terms and conditions, which included compliance with all
of the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”)’s referrals, rules, and
requirements, 1 acknowledge that I was discharged by MPRP for cause on May 13, 2024
for failing to comply with MPRP’s treatment recommendations and that this discharge
constituted a violation of the December 15, 2022 Order to Terminate Suspension and
Impose Probation.

I further acknowledge that the Board received a Mandated 10-Day Report from a
health care facility stating that 1 was terminated on January 22, 2024 for billing for
services under the name of a different provider.
