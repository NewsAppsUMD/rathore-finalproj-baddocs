Re: George Gatewood, III, P.A.
Case No.: 7724-0082 A
License No.: C02123

Dear Mr. Gatewood and Mr. Lockwood:

On April 29, 2025, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), against George Gatewood, III, P.A. Mr.
Gatewood was given an opportunity for a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to
argue that the order for summary suspension should not be continued. The post-deprivation hearing
was scheduled for May 14, 2025. On May 11, 2025, Mr. Gatewood requested a postponement of
the hearing in order to find an attorney among other reasons. On May 12, 2025, the Board granted
the postponement and rescheduled the post-deprivation hearing to be held on June 11, 2025. On
May 19, 2025, Mr. Gatewood sent an email to the Board stating that he would waive his right to
the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, no post-deprivation hearing will be held by Panel
A and the order for summary suspension, imposed on April 29, 2025, is reaffirmed and continues
in effect; and Mr. Gatewood may request an evidentiary hearing on the merits to appeal the order
for summary suspension.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under COMAR 10.32.02.081, Mr. Gatewood has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge on the order for summary suspension. This request
will be granted if the Board receives a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. The request for a hearing shall be sent to:

4201 Patterson Avenue - Baltimore, Maryland 21215
