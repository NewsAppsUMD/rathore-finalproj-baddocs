by [the Respondent’s] gestures.” These gestures involved the
Respondent hugging her in his office. Employee 4 “... asked the
other staff if, like, [the Respondent], does he do that to you guys
as well? If they say yes, then like I said, oh, then it must be really
just cultural stuff. But they said no, So that’s when I felt
uncomfortable, and I told them.”

c. Employee 4 told the Respondent that she was not comfortable
with him giving her hugs. When she told him “.., he was not
happy. To me, he seemed a little bit offended because probably

him.”
