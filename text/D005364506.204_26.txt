21. Peer Reviewer 2 provided an addendum to his original report which
emphasized the danger of the Respondent’s prescribing practices. Peer Reviewer 2
recommended that the Board issue a cease and desist order with respect to the
Respondent’s prescribing of all medications related to ADHD, depression, and anxiety
disorders. Peer Reviewer 2’s recommendation was based on concerns about the
Respondent’s choice of medications for the treatment of depression and anxiety in
addition to the use of non-controlled medications when treating ADHD. Peer Reviewer 2
found that the Respondent “failed to exercise safe medical practices such as recognizing
the side effects of medications, observing the recommended daily limits of medications,
and not adhering to the recommended age ranges for these medications.”
