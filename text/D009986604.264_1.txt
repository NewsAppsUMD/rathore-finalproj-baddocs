pending further proceedings. That Order summarily suspended the Respondent’s license
beginning on April 8, 2024. : ,

Under the Compact, Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 10(b), “if a license granted to a
physician by the member board in the state of principal license . . . is suspended, then all
licenses issued to the physician by member boards automatically be placed, without further
action necessary by any member board, on the same status...”

According to Rule 6.5e, “Upon receipt of notice from the Interstate Commission of
an action taken by the state of principal license, the other member boards shall immediately
place the Compact physician on the same status as the state of principal license.”

The Compact law states in Rule 6.5f, that “If the state of principal license reinstates
the disciplined Compact physician’s license, it shall notify the Interstate Commission that
the suspension has been terminated as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 5
business days after the suspension has ended. The Interstate Commission shall immediately
notify the other member boards. Those member boards shall reinstate the license in
accordance with the Medical Practice Act of that state.”

Based upon the foregoing, Panel A concludes that the Board is required to
automatically suspend the Respondent’s license until the Georgia Board suspension is

lifted.
