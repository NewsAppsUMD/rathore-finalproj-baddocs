ORDER
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Maryland Board of Physicians (the “Maryland Board”) received information
that Milind S. Gadgil, M.D. (the “Respondent’”), Maryland License Number D0097307, a
physician licensed to practice medicine in Maryland via the Interstate Medical Licensure
Compact (the “Compact”), was disciplined by the Nebraska Board of Medicine and
Surgery (the “Nebraska Board”). In an Order on Agreed Settlement, dated March 20,
2024, the Nebraska Board suspended the Respondent’s license for a period of six (6)
months, with reinstatement at the discretion of the Nebraska Board.

Based on the above mentioned Nebraska Board sanction, the Maryland Board is
authorized to discipline the Respondent, pursuant to the following:

Health Occ. §14-3A-01 Section 10 Disciplinary Actions provides:

(a) Any disciplinary action taken by any member board against a physician

licensed through the Compact shall be deemed unprofessional conduct that

may be subject to discipline by other member boards, in addition to any
violation of the Medical Practice Act or regulations in that state.

(c) If disciplinary action is taken against a physician by a member board not in
the state of principal license, any other member board may deem the action
conclusive as to matter of law and fact decided; and

(1) Impose the same or lesser sanction(s) against the physician so long as such
sanctions are consistent with the Medical Practice Act of that state[.]
