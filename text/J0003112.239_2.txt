On September 12, 2019, the ALJ issued a Revised Proposed Default Order,’ based upon
the OAH proceedings described above, which the ALJ recounted in the proposed decision, The

ALJ also proposed that the Panel:

2. Adopt as fact the statements set out in the Investigative Findings section of the

Notice of Intent to Revoke License to Practice Naturopathic Medicine;

3, Conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent violated subsections 14-5F-.

18(a)(9), (19) and (24) of the Health Occupations Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, in the
manner set forth in the Notice of Intent to Revoke License; and

4. Impose any disciplinary sanction against the Respondent the Panel deems
appropriate,

On September 12, 2019, copies of the ALJ’s Revised Proposed Default Order were
mailed to the Respondent, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board. The proposed decision
notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to the proposed decision but must do so
within 15 days of the date of the proposed order. The proposed order stated that any exceptions
must be sent to the Board disciplinary panel with attention to the Board’s Executive Director,
Neither party filed exceptions.

On October 30, 2019, the case came before Board Disciplinary Panel B for the final

disposition.

! The initial Proposed Default Order, issued on September 6, 2019, misspelled the Respondent’s
name, The Revised Proposed Default Order was issued, pursuant to COMAR 28.02.01.27C, to
correct that clerical mistake.
