that health care providers are immune from civil or criminal liability. ..” 100 Op. Att’y at 188. It
does not indicate physicians are immune from administrative sanctions. The statutes the
Respondent relies upon afford immunity in civil and criminal cases, but not in administrative
actions.

The Respondent also relies upon the “good faith” requirement included in each statute,
contending that his errors were unintentional. But as already explained, the Respondent’s conduct
at issue was neither in good faith nor unintentional. Panel B finds that the Respondent did not act
in good faith and finds that he acted with willful misconduct. The statutory protection for acts
made in good faith does not apply to the Respondent with respect to the six assessments at issue.

The Panel further agrees with the ALJ that the Respondent’s documentation and billing for
assessments that he did not perform are not consistent with acting “in accordance with” a
catastrophic health emergency disease surveillance and response program or “under” a
catastrophic health emergency proclamation. The catastrophic health emergency directives
concerned providing patients with examinations or assessments to protect against the spread of
COVID-19. Documenting and billing for assessments that did not take place does not align with
the catastrophic health emergency programs and proclamations. The Panel finds that the
Respondent is not entitled to immunity and denies the Respondent’s exception.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based upon the findings of fact and as explained above, Panel B concludes that the
Respondent: is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); willfully made or filed a false report or record in the practice of medicine,

in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(11); made a willful misrepresentation in treatment, in
