Re: Scott C. Moran, M.D.
Case No.: 2224-0143 B
License No.: D84252

Dear Dr. Moran and Counsel:

On June 11, 2024, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), against Scott C. Moran, M.D. Dr. Moran
was given an opportunity for a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to argue that
the order for summary suspension should not be continued. The post-deprivation hearing was
scheduled for June 26, 2024. On June 24, 2024, Dr. Moran’s attorney sent an email to the Board
stating that Dr. Moran waived his right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel
B did not hold the post-deprivation hearing; the order for summary suspension, imposed on June
11, 2024, is reaffirmed and continues in effect; and Dr. Moran may request an evidentiary hearing
on the merits to appeal the order for summary suspension.
