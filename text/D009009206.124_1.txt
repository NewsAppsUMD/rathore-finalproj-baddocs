regular mail was not returned as undeliverable. Dr. Otchere-Boateng did not notify OAH
or the Board of any change of mailing address. Dr. Otchere-Boateng did not make any
requests to OAH to postpone the February 26, 2024 remote Scheduling Conference. The
administrative prosecutor personally attempted to contact Dr. Otchere-Boateng by
telephone, email, and first-class mail, informing him of the proceedings. Dr. Otchere-
Boateng failed to respond to any of the outreach.

On February 26, 2024, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) commenced the
Scheduling Conference by video-conference, after an approximately 15 minute “grace
period” after the scheduled start time. The administrative prosecutor appeared on behalf
of the State. Dr. Otchere-Boateng did not appear, nor did anyone appear, on his behalf.
During the Scheduling Conference, a remote Prehearing Conference was scheduled for
March 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., via video-conference.

On February 26, 2024, the ALJ issued a Scheduling Order informing the parties that
a Remote Prehearing Conference would be held on March 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., via
video-conference. The Scheduling Order was sent by regular mail to the parties at their
addresses of record. On February 28, 2024, OAH sent a Notice of Remote Prehearing
Conference to the parties that notified the parties that a Prehearing Conference would be
held on March 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., by video-conference. The Notice of Prehearing
Conference informed Dr. Otchere-Boateng that the failure to appear at the Prehearing
Conference could result in a decision against him. The Notice was mailed by regular first-

class mail to Dr. Otchere-Boateng’s address of record. The mailed copy was not returned
