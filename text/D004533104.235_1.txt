PETITION FOR TERMINATION OF SUSPENSION

On February 6, 2025, Dr. Dietrick petitioned the Board for the termination of his
suspension. Dr. Dietrick completed the coursework required by the Consent Order. The
Board also received, as part of his Petition, a report from MPRP, on February 7, 2025, that
stated, “[d]uring his participation Dr. Dietrick has been fully cooperative with his MPRP
rehabilitation plan and all recommendations.” Ultimately, MPRP concluded, “[o]ur full
clinical team has discussed this case extensively and we endorse his return to clinical
practice. Furthermore, we recommend that Dr. Dietrick continue all elements of his current
rehabilitation program... .” On March 14, 2025, the Administrative Prosecutor filed a
response, recommending terminating the suspension and imposing probation with the
condition that he continue his participation in MPRP. On April 9, 2025, Panel A convened
as a Reinstatement Inquiry Panel, with Dr. Dietrick and an Administrative Prosecutor for
the State, for the Panel to consider Dr. Dietrick’s petition to terminate the suspension of
his license.

CONSIDERATION OF PETITION

Panel A finds that Dr. Dietrick has complied with the terms of the Consent Order
and, based on the recommendations and evaluations presented, is safe to return to the
practice of medicine. The Panel believes that Dr. Dietrick should remain on probation and
enrolled in MPRP for at least three years from the date of this Order Terminating
Suspension and Imposing Probation (“Order”) and until his successful discharge from

MPRP.
