Maryland Board of Physicians
4201 Patterson Avenue, Fourth Floor
Baltimore, Maryland 21215

If such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
a hearing within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from a
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore, a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File

Christine A. Farrelly, ExdcutWe Director /
Maryland State Board of Physicians
