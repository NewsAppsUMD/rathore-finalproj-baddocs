CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B adopts the ALJ’s revised proposed finding, pursuant to COMAR 28.02.01.23A,
that the Respondent defaulted based upon the Respondent’s failure to appear at OAH for the
Scheduling Conference on August 27, 2019. See State Gov’t § 10-210(4). Based upon the
findings of fact, Panel B concludes that the Respondent willfully made or filed a false report or
record in the practice of naturopathic medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5F-18(a)(9); is
guilty of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of naturopathic medicine, in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-5F-18(a)(19); and failed to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted
by the Board, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5F-18(a)(24).

Sanction

As a sanction, the ALJ proposed that the Board impose any disciplinary action against the
Respondent it finds appropriate. A Notice of Intent to Revoke License to Practice Naturopathic
Medicine was issued against the Respondent, because the Respondent failed to submit her CPR
certificate as required by the license renewal process, misrepresented to the Board in her renewal
application that she would do so, and failed to respond to the Board’s investigative
correspondence, Based upon the Respondent’s disregard for the requirements of licensure and
the renewal process, Panel B finds that the appropriate sanction is the -revocation of the
Respondent’s license to practice naturopathic medicine in Maryland,
