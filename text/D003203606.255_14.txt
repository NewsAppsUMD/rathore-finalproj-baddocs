were unfamiliar with the type of false records produced by the Respondent here. And Patient 3’s
record at issue and Patient 4’s record at issue were not merely daily COVID-19 evaluations. In

statements to collect feeds for which services were not provided, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(11), (17), and (23).

at the time of the Cornfeld decision) held that the physician’s false statements to a hospital review

investigator and to the Board regarding treatment he had provided constituted unprofessional
