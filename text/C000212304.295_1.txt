INTRODUCTION
1, Panel A is summarily suspending the Respondent’s license to practice as a
physician assistant after a Board investigation revealed that he has a health condition that
affects his ability to practice medicine safely.

BACKGROUND/LICENSING INFORMATION

2. At all relevant times, the Respondent was licensed to practice as a physician
assistant in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally issued a license to
practice as a physician assistant in Maryland on February 11, 1999, under License Number
C02123. The Respondent’s license expires on June 30, 2025, subject to renewal.

THE DISPOSITION AGREEMENT

3. On or about May 1, 2024, the Respondent and the Board entered into a non-
public Disposition Agreement. The Respondent and the Board entered into the Disposition
Agreement after it “came to the Board’s attention that the Respondent has been diagnosed
with a health condition that may impact the Respondent’s ability to practice medicine
safely. The health condition indicated to Panel A that the Respondent and the public would
benefit from the Respondent entering into a Disposition Agreement.”

4. The Disposition Agreement that the Respondent voluntarily entered into
required him in part to “enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program”
(“MPRP”) and “fully and timely cooperate with all MPRP’s referrals, rules, and

requirements.”
