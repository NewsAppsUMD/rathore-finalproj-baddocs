FINDINGS OF FACT
Because Panel B concludes that the Respondent has defaulted, the following findings of

fact are adopted from the Investigative Findings set forth in the January 2, 2019, Notice of Intent

to Revoke License to Practice Naturopathic Medicine and are deemed proven by the

preponderance of the evidence:

Maryland on July 7, 2017 (License Number J00031). The Respondent’s renewed license had the’

expiration date of March 31, 2020.

On or. about February 27, 2018, the Respondent submitted an online application (the
“Application”) for the renewal of the Respondent’s license using the Board’s online renewal
application process.

The Respondent attested on her Application that she possessed a current, valid CPR
certificate and that she would send a copy to the Board within fifteen days after the expiration
date of her license, i.e. March 31, 2018.

By email, dated April 30, 2018, Board staff informed the Respondent that the Board had
not received a copy of the Respondent’s CPR certificate. Board staff further informed the
Respondent that the Respondent had ten business days to submit the CPR certificate. As of the
date of the Notice of Intent to Revoke, the Respondent had not replied to the email,

By letter dated May 21, 2018, the Board informed the Respondent that the Board had
opened a preliminary investigation based upon her failure to provide the CPR certificate for

license renewal despite her attestation that the Respondent would do so.

As of the.date of the Notice of Intent to Revoke, the Respondent had not responded to the ,

letter nor did the Respondent submit the required CPR certificate.
