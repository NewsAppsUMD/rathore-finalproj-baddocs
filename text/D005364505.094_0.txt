Case No.: 2224-0040
License No.: D53645

Dear Dr. Ramirez and Counsel:

On April 30, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl. Vol.). Dr. Ramirez
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on May 8, 2024, before Disciplinary
Panel A, to show cause why that suspension should not be continued.

Prior to the scheduled hearing, Dr. Ramirez’s counsel, Curtis H. Booth, Esq., contacted the
Board in writing and stated that Dr. Ramirez waived his right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due
to the waiver, Panel A did not hold a post-deprivation hearing in this matter. Therefore, the
Summary Suspension imposed on April 30, 2024 is Reaffirmed and continues in effect, and
the parties may proceed to the Summary Suspension appeal. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

In the same letter, Dr. Ramirez’s counsel requested an evidentiary hearing before an
Administrative Law Judge, pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.08I and J. Because such a hearing has
been requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day requirement may be
waived.
