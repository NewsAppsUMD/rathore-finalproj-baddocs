be considered unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).
SANCTION

The ALJ did not recommend a sanction. The State recommended a revocation based
on the facts in the charging documents that Dr. Otchere-Boateng engaged in harassing
behavior that constituted unprofessional conduct and based on his complete failure to
cooperate with the Board’s investigation. Based on the findings of fact and the State’s
written exceptions argument, Panel A concludes that the revocation of Dr. Otchere-
Boateng’s license to practice medicine in Maryland is warranted.

ORDER

It is, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Panel A, hereby

ORDERED that the license of Yaw Otchere-Boateng, M.D. to practice medicine in
Maryland is REVOKED; and it is further

ORDERED that this Order of Default goes into effect upon the signature of the
Board’s Executive Director or her designee. The Board’s Executive Director or her
designee signs this Order of Default on behalf of Panel A; and it is further

ORDERED that this is a public document. See Health Occ. §§ 1-607, 14-

411.1(b)(2), and Md. Code Ann., Gen. Prov. § 4-333(b)(6).
