or filing a false report or record in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(11); and violated a regulation adopted by the Board and State law pertaining to
the practice of medicine under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(43). The violations referenced in
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(43) include Health Occ. § 1-212, which is a violation for sexual

finds violations related to sexual, contact, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct.
Finally, the Board finds that Dr. Lizardi does not possess good moral character, which is a
requirement of licensure. See Health Occ. § 14-307(b).
