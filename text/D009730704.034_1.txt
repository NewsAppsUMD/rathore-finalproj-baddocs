FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel B makes the following findings of fact and deems it conclusive as a matter of fact
decided pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 Section 10(c):

1, The Respondent was licensed to practice in Maryland on or about April
25, 2023, under License Number D0097307 pursuant to the Compact.

2. In its Order on Agreed Settlement, the Nebraska Board found that, in April
2023, the Respondent began displaying concerning behavior while employed at a
Nebraska clinic, including regularly arriving late for work, laughing at inappropriate
times, and other abnormal behavior. Coworkers reported the Respondent smelled like
alcohol at times.

3. On May 1, 2023, upon arrival at work, the Respondent’s co-workers
reported that he smelled of alcohol, so the Respondent was scheduled for a for-cause drug
screen. Two alcohol breathalyzer tests yielded positive blood alcohol contents of .222

and .259.
