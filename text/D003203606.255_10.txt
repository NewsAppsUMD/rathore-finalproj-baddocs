DISCUSSION OF CHARGES

The Respondent filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision, arguing that the ALJ
made erroneous findings or determinations on the following issues: (1) willfulness; (2) the scope
of immunity for health care practitioners during the COVID-19 Pandemic; and (3) the proposed
sanction?
L Willfulness

The Respondent was charged with four grounds under § 14-404(a) of the Health
Occupations Article. Three of the four grounds have a willfulness element. Those three grounds
are:

(11) Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of medicine;

(17) Makes a willful misrepresentation in treatment; [and]

(23) Willfully submits false statements to collect fees for which services are not provided[.]

The ALJ addressed the requirements of the willfulness element contained in § 14-
404(a)(11), (17), and (23) of the Health Occupations Article? The ALJ thoroughly reviewed Kim
yv. Maryland State Board of Physicians, 423 Md. 523 (2011), which concerns the meaning of
willfulness in the context of § 14-404(a). The ALJ explained that Kim ruled that, in grounds with
a willfulness element in § 14-404(a), a finding of willfulness does not require proof of an intent to
deceive or a malicious intent. Instead, the ALJ found that, in the § 14-404(a) grounds containing

the willfulness element, there must be proof that the conduct was committed intentionally.

? Discussion of the Respondent’s exceptions concerning the proposed sanction is in the Sanction
section.

> All references to § 14-404(a) in this final decision and order concern § 14-404(a) of the Health
Occupations Article.
