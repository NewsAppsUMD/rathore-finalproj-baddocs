Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B:

Please be advised that | have decided to PERMANENTLY SURRENDER my
license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D27925,
effective immediately upon the Board’s acceptance of this letter. | understand that upon
surrender of my license, | may not give medical advice or treatment to any individual,
with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage in
the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical
Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. Il (“Health Occ.”), §§ 14-101 et
seq., (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2016 Supp.) and other applicable laws. In other words, as of
the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, | understand that the surrender of my
license means that | am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of
Maryland.

| understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT and on the
acceptance of Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (“Panel
B” of the “Board”), becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B.

On September 2, 2016, Panel B issued a final order (the “Order’), in case
number 2015-0022 (attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1). /nter alia, the Order:
concluded that | committed immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii); suspended my license for
a minimum period of one year; and required that | enroll in the Maryland Professional
Rehabilitation Program (MPRP) within fifteen business days. After an investigation, the
Board voted to issue charges that | violated the requirement that | enroll in the MPRP
