conduct in the practice of medicine. The ALJ found, “[h]ere, the Respondent’s willfully false
record-making, misrepresentations in treatment and in billing constitute unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine.” Panel B accepts the ALJ’s determination. The Panel finds the
Respondent guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)Gii).
I. Issue of Immunity based on COVID-19 Catastrophic Health Emergency

The Respondent had entered into evidence two documents signed by the Maryland
Governor, at the time of the events at issue, concerning the COVID-19 Pandemic: the Order of the
Governor of the State of Maryland, Amending and Restating the Order Dated April 5, 2020
Authorizing Various Actions related to Nursing Homes and Other Health Facilities, dated April 29,
2020 (Order of the Governor); and the State of Maryland Renewal of Declaration of State of
Emergency and Existence of Catastrophic Health Emergency - COVID-19, dated July 30, 20204
(Renewal of Declaration). It appears the Respondent presented these documents as part of his
argument that he is entitled to immunity from the administrative action against him.

In the proceeding at OAH, the Respondent cited two statutory provisions: Md. Code Ann.,
Pub. Safety § 14-3A-06 and Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. § 18-907(d). Section 14-3A-06 of the
Public Safety Article states, “A health care provider is immune from civil or criminal liability if
the health care provider acts in good faith and under a catastrophic health emergency
proclamation.” Section 18-907(d) of the Health-General Article states, “A health care provider

acting in good faith and in accordance with a catastrophic health emergency disease surveillance

‘ As noted by the ALJ, this second document was issued after the Respondent had completed the
six assessments at issue.
