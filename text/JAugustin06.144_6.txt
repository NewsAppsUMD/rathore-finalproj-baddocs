Health Occ. § 14-5D-14(a)(17), with underlying grounds of § 14-5D-14(a)(3). The Panel also
agrees with the ALJ that Mr. Augustin does not qualify for a license under Health Occ. § 14-5D-
14(b)(2). The denial is not based on Health Occ. § 1-212.
DISPOSITION

Panel B agrees with the ALJ that the denial of Mr. Augustin’s application for licensure to
practice athletic training in Maryland is warranted. Mr. Augustin’s conviction of sexual abuse of
a minor and inappropriate relationship with the minor while he was employed as an athletic trainer
are undisputed. Mr. Augustin has not demonstrated that he meets the good moral character
requirement of licensure or that he has been sufficiently rehabilitated to prevent a similar incident
from happening in the future.

ORDER

It is, on the affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum of Board Disciplinary Panel B,
hereby

ORDERED that the application of Jimmy R. Augustin, dated December 6, 2022, for a

license to practice athletic training in Maryland is DENIED.
