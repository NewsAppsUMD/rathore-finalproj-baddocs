  "summary": "Bede I. Nnolim, M.D.'s application for initial medical licensure was denied by default after he failed to appear for a prehearing conference. The Board found he fraudulently attempted to obtain a license by making false representations and failing to disclose a prior misdemeanor arrest and disciplinary action from another state's medical board. As a result, his application for a Maryland medical license was permanently denied due to these violations and a lack of good moral character.",
