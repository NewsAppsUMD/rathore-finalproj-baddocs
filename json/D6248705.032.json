  "summary": "Dr. Robert Schnitzlein, a psychiatrist, was disciplined for engaging in a sexual relationship and inappropriate communication with a former patient whom he treated for serious mental health issues. His license was summarily suspended, and a consent order resulted in a minimum one-year suspension, reprimand, ethics course, MPRP enrollment, and a $15,000 fine. After his petition to terminate the suspension was denied and the suspension extended, Dr. Schnitzlein voluntarily surrendered his license to avoid further charges for non-compliance with the suspension conditions due to a medical condition.",
