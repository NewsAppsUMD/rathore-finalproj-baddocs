  "summary": "Dr. Bernard Cohen's medical license was suspended due to findings of professional, physical, or mental incompetence, including practicing while on medical leave and exhibiting forgetfulness and inappropriate patient care. An independent evaluation concluded that his medical condition almost certainly precludes his ability to independently practice medicine. His license remains suspended, and he is required to undergo a comprehensive evaluation by the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program to determine his fitness to practice medicine safely.",
