  "summary": "Andrea N. Bailey, M.D.'s Maryland medical license was revoked in 2018 for violating a prior Consent Order, repeated prescription fraud convictions in Virginia, practicing without a valid license, and making false statements on license applications. Her application for reinstatement, filed in 2022, was denied by the Maryland State Board of Physicians on March 14, 2024. The Board concluded that reinstatement was not in the public interest, citing Dr. Bailey's continued minimization of her conduct and lack of full accountability.",
