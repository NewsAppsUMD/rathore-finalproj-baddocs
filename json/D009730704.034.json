Coworkers reported he smelled of alcohol and displayed concerning behavior, leading to positive breathalyzer tests with high blood alcohol content during work hours. As a result, his Nebraska medical license was suspended for six months, and the Maryland Board of Physicians reciprocally suspended his Maryland license until the Nebraska license is reinstated.",
