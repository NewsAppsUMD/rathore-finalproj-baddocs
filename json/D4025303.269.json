  "summary": "Dr. Michael J. Quon's medical license was summarily suspended by the Maryland State Board of Physicians. The disciplinary action was taken due to his admission of self-prescribing opioid and benzodiazepine Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS), prescribing CDS to eight other individuals for his own use (drug diversion), and failure to maintain medical records for these prescriptions. The Board concluded that his actions imperatively required emergency action for public health and safety.",
