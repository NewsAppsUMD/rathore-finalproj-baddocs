Re: Scott C. Moran, M.D.
Case No.: 2224-0143 B
License No.: D84252

Dear Dr. Moran and Counsel:

On June 11, 2024, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), against Scott C. Moran, M.D. Dr. Moran
was given an opportunity for a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to argue that
the order for summary suspension should not be continued. The post-deprivation hearing was
scheduled for June 26, 2024. On June 24, 2024, Dr. Moran’s attorney sent an email to the Board
stating that Dr. Moran waived his right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel
B did not hold the post-deprivation hearing; the order for summary suspension, imposed on June
11, 2024, is reaffirmed and continues in effect; and Dr. Moran may request an evidentiary hearing
on the merits to appeal the order for summary suspension.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under COMAR 10.32.02.08I, Dr. Moran has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge on the order for summary suspension. This request will be
granted if the Board receives a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of
this letter. The request for a hearing shall be sent to:

Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director
Maryland Board of Physicians

4201 Patterson Avenue, Fourth Floor
Baltimore, Maryland 21215

If such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
a hearing within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.081, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from a
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore, a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File

Ellen Douglas Smith, Deputy Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
