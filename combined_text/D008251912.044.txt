Case No.: 2225-0066
License No.: D0082519

Dear Dr. Ratliff and Counsel:

On November 22, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). Dr. Ratliff
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued on December 4, 2024. Prior to the
scheduled hearing Dr. Ratliff’s counsel contacted the Board and stated that Dr. Ratliff waived his
right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel A did not hold a post-deprivation
hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties may proceed to the
summary suspension appeal if Dr. Ratliff requests an evidentiary hearing as referenced below.
COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Ratliff has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a
written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If
such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the

hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day
requirement may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File

Executive Director
