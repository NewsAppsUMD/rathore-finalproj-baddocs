Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Henry Holcomb, M.D.

License Number: D27903

Case Number: 2224-0079

Dear Dr. Olszyk and Members of Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”) §14-403,
Thave decided to SURRENDER my license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License
Number D27903, effective immediately. ] understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not
give medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot
prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as
it is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seg. and
other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I
understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed
individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A of the
Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

lL acknowledge that the Board received a complaint alleging that | engaged in inappropriate
communication with a patient. The Board began an investigation of these allegations. I have
decided to surrender my license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland to avoid further
investigation. I recognize that for all purposes relevant to medical licensure that these allegations
shall be treated as proven and that these allegations support a conclusion that I violated Health
Occ. §14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) (is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine) and Health Occ. §1-212 for violating the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations.

I wish to make it clear that I have voluntarily, knowingly and freely chosen to submit this
Letter of Surrender to avoid the issuance of charges and prosecution of the aforementioned
allegations. I do not wish to contest these allegations. I understand that by executing this Letter
of Surrender | am waiving my right to contest any charges that would issue from Panel A’s
investigative findings in a formal evidentiary hearing at which I would have had the right to
counsel, to confront witnesses, to give testimony, to call witnesses on my own behalf and all other
substantive and procedural protections provided by law, including the right to appeal to circuit
court.

I understand that the Board will advise the Federation of State Medical Boards and the
National Practitioner Data Bank of this Letter of Surrender. I also understand that in the event I
would apply for licensure in any form in any other state or jurisdiction that this Letter of Surrender
may be released or published by the Board to the same extent as a final order that would result
from disciplinary action, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Gen. Prov. §§ 4-101 ef seq., and that this
Letter of Surrender constitutes a disciplinary action by Panel A.

I affirm that I will provide access to and copies of medical records to my patients in
compliance with Title 4, subtitle 3 of the Health General Article. I also agree to surrender my
Controlled Dangerous Substance Registration to the Office of Controlled Substances
Administration.

I further recognize and agree that by submitting this Letter of Surrender, my license will
remain surrendered unless and until the Board grants reinstatement. In the event that I apply for
reinstatement of my Maryland License, I understand that Panel A or its successor is not required
to grant reinstatement; and, if it does grant reinstatement, may impose any terms and conditions
the disciplinary panel considers appropriate for public safety and the protection of the integrity
and reputation of the profession. I further understand that if I ever file a petition for reinstatement,
1 will approach Panel A or its successor in the same position as an individual whose license has
been revoked.

IL acknowledge that I may not rescind this Letter of Surrender in part or in its entirety for
any reason whatsoever. Finally, I wish to make clear that I have been advised of my right to be
represented by an attorney of my choice throughout proceedings before Panel A, including the
right to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Letter of Surrender. I understand both the
nature of Panel A’s actions and this Letter of Surrender fully. I acknowledge that I understand and
comprehend the language, meaning and terms and effect of this Letter of Surrender. | make this

decision knowingly and voluntarily.
Very truly vou)
