Case No.: 2225-0124 A
License No.: D66302

Dear Dr. Wormuth and Counsel:

On March 26, 2025, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), against Jennifer Wormuth, M.D. Dr.
Wormuth was given an opportunity for a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to
argue that the order for summary suspension should not be continued. The post-deprivation hearing
was scheduled for April 9, 2025. On April 7, 2025, Dr. Wormuth’s attorney sent an email to the
Board stating that Dr. Wormuth would waive her right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the
waiver, Panel A did not hold the post-deprivation hearing; the order for summary suspension,
imposed on March 26, 2025, is reaffirmed and continues in effect; and Dr. Wormuth may request
an evidentiary hearing on the merits to appeal the order for summary suspension.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under COMAR 10.32.02.081, Dr. Wormuth has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge on the order for summary suspension. This request
will be granted if the Board receives a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. The request for a hearing shall be sent to:

4201 Patterson Avenue - Baltimore, Maryland 21215
410-764-4777 - Toll Free 1-800-492-6836 - Deaf and Hard of Hearing Use Relay

If such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
a hearing within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day requirement

may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from a
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore, a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File
