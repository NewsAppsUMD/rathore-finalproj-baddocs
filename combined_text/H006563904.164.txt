ORDER TERMINATING SUSPENSION AND IMPOSING PROBATION

On October 11, 2022, Jeffery Dormu, D.O. (the “Respondent”) and Disciplinary Panel A
(“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) entered into a Consent Order!
wherein Panel A concluded, as a matter of law, that the Respondent grossly overutilized health
care services, failed to meet the standard of care for the delivery of quality medical services, and
failed to keep adequate medical records.

Under the terms of the Consent Order, Panel A reprimanded the Respondent, suspended
the Respondent’s Maryland medical license for a minimum period of thirty (30) calendar days*
and until a supervisor board certified in vascular surgery is approved by Panel A.3 The Consent
Order also provided that after the minimum period of suspension has passed, and after receiving
Panel A’s approval of a supervisor, the Respondent may submit a written petition for termination
of suspension. In addition, the Consent Order provided that the Panel may terminate the suspension
following a determination of the Respondent’s compliance with the relevant terms of the Consent
Order, and upon termination, the Respondent is placed on probation for a minimum period of two

years with probationary terms and conditions.

' The October 11, 2022 Consent Order is incorporated by reference and available by request.

° Terms of the suspension included a prohibition on the Respondent's practice of medicine, implementation of a
procedure for the Respondent’s patients to obtain their medical records, and a requirement that the Respondent notify
in writing all associated athletic trainers, physician assistants, and naturopathic doctors of the termination of any
protocols, delegation agreements, or collaborative agreements.

5 The Respondent’s license expired on September 30, 2022. As a result, the terms and conditions of the Consent Order
were tolled. The Board reinstated the Respondent’s medical license on February 28, 2024.

 
On March 27, 2024, the Respondent petitioned Panel A to terminate the suspension of his
Maryland medical license, provided Panel A with the name and pertinent professional background
information of a supervisor who is board-certified in vascular surgery to supervise him for the
duration of the probationary period, and, on April 10, 2024, Panel A approved the Respondent’s
supervisor.

The Respondent has complied with the relevant terms of the October 11, 2022 Consent
Order. It is thus hereby

ORDERED that the suspension imposed under the Consent Order dated October 11, 2022,
is TERMINATED; and it is further

ORDERED that the Respondent is placed on probation for a minimum period of TWO
(2) YEARS.‘ During the probationary period, the Respondent shall comply with the following
probationary terms and conditions:

(1) Within SIX (6) MONTHS of the effective date of this Order Terminating Suspension

and Imposing Probation, the Respondent is required to take and successfully complete
a course in medical recordkeeping and a course in professional ethics. The following
terms apply:

disciplinary panel’s approval of the course before the course has begun;

(b) the Respondent must provide documentation to the disciplinary panel that the

panel: and if the disciplinary panel determines there is no genuine dispute as to a material fact, the
Respondent shall be given a show cause hearing before a disciplinary panel; and it is further

Respondent has failed to comply with any term or condition imposed by this Order Terminating
Suspension and Imposing Probation, the disciplinary panel may reprimand the Respondent, place
the Respondent on probation with appropriate terms and conditions, or suspend with appropriate
