conflicting information regarding the Respondent's current practice. They also shared
concerns regarding the Respondent’s ability to practice.

gathered during the on-site visit, on January 22, 2025, the Board sent the Respondent a
letter and an email directing the Respondent to appear at the office of the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program (““MPRP”) on Wednesday, January 29, 2025 at 10:00
a.m. for an intake evaluation for purposes of scheduling an examination”

8. The letter and email also advised the Respondent that pursuant to Md. Code
Ann., Health Occupations § 14-402(c), the unreasonable failure or refusal to submit to an
examination is prima facie evidence of a licensed medical practitioner’s inability to
practice medicine, unless the Board finds that the failure or refusal was beyond the control
of the individual.

acknowledging receipt of the communication and asking who to contact at MPRP.

Code Ann., Health Occupations § 14-402(c), the unreasonable failure or refusal to submit

practice medicine, unless the Board finds that the failure or refusal was beyond the control
of the individual.

and Dr. Beals did not notify the Board or MPRP of any reason that he was unable to appear.
