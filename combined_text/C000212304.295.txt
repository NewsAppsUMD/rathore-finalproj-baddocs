Gov’t §10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl. Vol. and 2024 Supp.) and Md. Code Regs. (“COMAR”)

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the

following facts are true:!

' The statements regarding the Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with
reasonable notice of the basis of Panel A’s action. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily
represent, a complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against
the Respondent in connection with this matter.

INTRODUCTION
1, Panel A is summarily suspending the Respondent’s license to practice as a
physician assistant after a Board investigation revealed that he has a health condition that
affects his ability to practice medicine safely.

BACKGROUND/LICENSING INFORMATION

2. At all relevant times, the Respondent was licensed to practice as a physician
assistant in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally issued a license to
practice as a physician assistant in Maryland on February 11, 1999, under License Number
C02123. The Respondent’s license expires on June 30, 2025, subject to renewal.

THE DISPOSITION AGREEMENT

3. On or about May 1, 2024, the Respondent and the Board entered into a non-
public Disposition Agreement. The Respondent and the Board entered into the Disposition
Agreement after it “came to the Board’s attention that the Respondent has been diagnosed
with a health condition that may impact the Respondent’s ability to practice medicine
safely. The health condition indicated to Panel A that the Respondent and the public would
benefit from the Respondent entering into a Disposition Agreement.”

4. The Disposition Agreement that the Respondent voluntarily entered into
required him in part to “enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program”
(“MPRP”) and “fully and timely cooperate with all MPRP’s referrals, rules, and

requirements.”

BOARD INVESTIGATION

5. After entering into the Disposition Agreement, the Board received
information from MPRP on November 12, 2024, that the Respondent was not in
compliance with all of its rules, referrals, and requirements, including but not limited to
the terms and conditions of his Participant Rehabilitation Plan and Agreement.

6. On or about December 11, 2024, the Board received information from MPRP
that the Respondent signed a practice cessation agreement based in part on his non-
compliance with his Participant Rehabilitation Plan and Agreement.

7. On or about March 25, 2025, the Board received additional information that
the Respondent was non-compliant with his Participant Rehabilitation Plan and
Agreement. It also was reported that since being enrolled in MPRP, the Respondent failed
to appear for multiple scheduled appointments. MPRP also informed the Board that
Respondent was diagnosed with a medical condition that negatively impacts his ability to
safely practice medicine.* The Respondent admitted to the Board in an April 8, 2025 email
that he has not complied with all of the terms and conditions of his MPRP Participant
Rehabilitation Plan and Agreement.
