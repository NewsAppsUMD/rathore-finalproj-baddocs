License No.: D59281

Dear Dr. Malik and Ms. Miller:

On July 31, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).

Pursuant to the Order, on August 14, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A held a post-deprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Malik did not attend the
hearing on that date. The State was represented by JoAnna Miller, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Ms. Miller presented oral arguments arguing that the summary
suspension should be upheld.

After considering the State’s argument at the hearing and the documents in the
investigative file, Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary
suspension imposed on July 31, 2024. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary
suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare
imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Malik’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).

The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

. Under the Board regulations, Dr. Malik has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To receive the
evidentiary hearing, Dr. Malik or his counsel must file the request for the hearing within TEN
(10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely requested, the regulations
require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request,
see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
