Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of DANIEL D. METZ, P.A.
(the “Respondent”), License Number C05820, to practice as a physician assistant in the
State of Maryland.

Panel B takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t § 10-226(c) (2021 Repl. Vol. & 2024 Supp.), and Md. Code Regs. (“COMAR”)
10.32.02.08B(7), concluding that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires

emergency action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel B, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel B, including the instances described below, Panel B has reason to believe that the

following facts are true: !

1 The statements regarding Panel B’s investigative findings are intended to provide the Respondent with
reasonable notice of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent,
a complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the
Respondent in connection with this matter.
IL BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was licensed to practice as a
physician assistant in the State of Maryland. The Respondent initially was licensed to
practice as a physician assistant in Maryland on July 8, 2015, under License Number
C05820. The Respondent’s license expires on June 30, 2025, subject to renewal.

2. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was employed as a physician
assistant at a health care facility (the “Facility”) located in Baltimore, Maryland.

3. On or about March 17, 2025, the Board opened an investigation of the
Respondent after receiving a Mandated 10-Day Report from the Facility stating that on
February 26, 2025, it summarily suspended the Respondent’s Facility privileges after
finding the Respondent sleeping in the dictation room and based on reasonable suspicion
that the Respondent was under the influence of alcohol while working at the Facility. The
Respondent also had a positive blood alcohol test that same day. The Respondent was
terminated from the Facility on March 12, 2025.

Il. BOARD INVESTIGATION

4, As part of its investigation, the Board obtained medical and administrative
records from the Facility and other health care facilities with which the Respondent was
employed or associated. Board staff also conducted an under-oath interview of the
Respondent.

5. The Board’s investigation revealed that on or about the morning of February
26, 2025, the Respondent appeared at the Facility at approximately 8:00 a.m. for work.

Shortly thereafter, Facility staff found the Respondent asleep on a desk in the dictation
room. At approximately 10:00 a.m., Facility staff referred the Respondent to the Facility’s
occupational health services and directed him to report there immediately. The Respondent,
however, did not appear at occupational health services until approximately 3:00 p.m.

6. When occupational health staff asked the Respondent where he had been
since being referred at 10:00 a.m., the Respondent stated that he had been sleeping in his
vehicle. During his evaluation by occupational health staff, the Respondent acknowledged
that he had drank alcohol that day and acknowledged a significant history of alcohol abuse.
The Respondent stated that after a long period of sobriety, he began drinking alcohol again
in November 2024 due to work-related stress and pressure.

ds The Respondent agreed to undergo an alcohol blood test at occupational
health services, the results of which indicated he was under the influence with an elevated
blood alcohol content.

8. On or about May 9, 2025, the Respondent was interviewed by Board staff
under oath during which he admitted to drinking alcohol after midnight and appearing at
the Facility on February 26, 2025 for work.
